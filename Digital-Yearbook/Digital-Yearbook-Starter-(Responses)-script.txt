//Digital Yearbook Starter (Responses) Script

//Intro
//this script is about starting off the yearbook compliment chain mail process. at this point, you are about to send a form to everyone
//in your community asking them to join in the Digital Yearbook. 
//this script sends an email to each correspondent from your form asking them to write something nice about someone using your other form.
//note that i didn't add a question in the form to collect email addresses. i recommend that you go into the Form settings and automatically 
//collect email addresses from a Gmail group of users. this also functions as a security feature, as it prohibits anyone outside your Gmail
//group from accessing the form.

//Important
//1) You need to go into the "Digital Yearbook Starter (Responses)" Google Sheet and grab the SSID and paste into the "" next to "var JOINSSID ="
//the Spreadsheet ID (SSID) is the long string of letters and numbers after the "d/" and before the next "/" in the address bar of the Responses SS.
//2) Don't forget to edit the emails that this form automatically sends. change the sender email address and signature at the very least :)
//find the automatic email in the script below. it is the heavily indented red text part. 
//3) You also need to scroll down to the bottom of this script and replace "REPLACE-THIS-TEXT-WITH-FORM-LINK" with the link to your 
//"The Digital Yearbook" form (not the "The Digital Yearbook Starter" form). do that by opening the "The Digital Yearbook" form and clicking on "Send".
//click the link icon which looks like <=> and then click on "Copy". now you can CNTL + V to paste the link in the right place below in this script.


//   var SSID = "1d1YY5MmXLKASNICoT2opETeNRj5fEGuI3hhiZsDSuOQ"; <--this is an example Spreadsheet ID
var JOINSSID = "";


//whenever anyone fills out the form, this function triggers
//it sends an email to the most recent correspondent asking for them to write about a random name from the list of names in the second tab
function responseTrigger() {
  var data = SpreadsheetApp.openById(JOINSSID).getSheets()[0].getDataRange().getValues();
  for (var i = 1; i < data.length; ++i) {
    var email = data[i][1];
    if (email.length > 0) {
      var name = getName(email);
      sendFormNoMostRecent(email,name)
      SpreadsheetApp.openById(JOINSSID).getSheets()[0].getRange(i+1,1).clear();
      SpreadsheetApp.openById(JOINSSID).getSheets()[0].getRange(i+1,2).clear();
      SpreadsheetApp.openById(JOINSSID).getSheets()[0].getRange(i+1,3).clear();
      SpreadsheetApp.flush();
    }
  }
}

//this randomly selects a member of the group from the Google Sheet and returns that person's name
function getName(email) {
  var data = SpreadsheetApp.openById(JOINSSID).getSheets()[1].getDataRange().getValues();
  var choice = Math.floor(Math.random() * data.length);
  var name = data[choice];
  return name;
}


//sends an email to "email" (a string -- email address) asking them to write something nice about "name", 
//a person randomly selected from the complete list of community member names in a spreadsheet
