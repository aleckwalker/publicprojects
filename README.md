Here are some projects I have created for fun that I hope vieweres will find interesting or useful. Questions, implementation challenges, comments? email me: alecwalker (at) alumni.gsb.stanford.edu

<b>CoW (Coffee on Wednesdays)</b> is an app that lets you automate 1-on-1 meetings at mutually agreeable times within a community to foster deeper platonic personal connections. Worked really well with business school students meeting up at a campus coffee shop, and worked pretty well with a remote team during the COVID-19 pandemic meeting up on video calls. 

<b>The Digital Yearbook</b> is an app that creates for a community collection of friendly comments written between individuals in that community. Worked pretty well for business school students, and worked pretty well for a few growing startup teams.

<b>Random Forest Visualizer</b> is an app that implements the popular data science method random forest within Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Working well for scientists and engineers who (A) like to visualize the intermediate steps in data science methods in order to ensure proper functioning and transparency on appliability and (B) who work in industries that rely on Excel to store and manipulate data.
